# REST API learning excercise

[excercises.md](./excercises.md) contains a homework assignment I wrote in 2020 as part of an interview process. The goal was to learn about REST APIs by completing the tasks.

The excercise includes fetching and running a containerized python Flask API, which was also written by me for this task.

The following were the requirements to cover:
>- The goal of the project is to teach students what is a HTTP REST API
>- Students should learn about what HTTP methods there are, major status codes, HTTP headers and their effects (like requesting a resource with Content-Type: application/json vs application/xml or something)  
>- We give them a virtual machine image or a docker image which contains a webserver a fakejson-server or something similar that can server requests and can handle POST, PUT and other type of requests
>- Students should use a tool like Insomnia or Postman to interact with the webserver
>- Students should shift the state of the webserver and the resources it stores with their requests in a "meaningful" way, they should see collection resources, creating, updating, deleting one or more resources
>- Any idea you have incorporate it freely or skip something that you deem irrelevant
